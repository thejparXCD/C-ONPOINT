                Webflow has implemented several features to assist users in
                creating accessible websites:


                -HTML5 Tagging UI: Allows users to add descriptive tags to
                elements, enhancing semantic structure.

                -ALT Attribute Fields for Images: Facilitates the addition of
                alternative text to images, improving screen reader
                accessibility.

                -Accessible Prebuilt Layouts: Provides layouts designed with
                accessibility best practices, including proper heading hierarchy
                and keyboard navigation.

      The Celebration OnPoint website has been evaluated against the Revised
      Section 508 Functional Performance Criteria to identify any potential
      barriers for users with disabilities. Below is a summary of key findings
      and accessibility considerations:

                The website is designed to be compatible with screen readers
                (JAWS, NVDA, VoiceOver) and uses semantic HTML and ARIA
                attributes. However, some images currently lack alternative text
                due to a recent migration. Updates are in progress to restore
                missing alt text.

                Most content is accessible to users with low vision, but some
                text elements have insufficient contrast (1.06:1). Planned
                updates will adjust colors to meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast
                requirements (4.5:1).

                The website is navigable via keyboard, ensuring access for users
                with limited dexterity. However, some small clickable elements
                (e.g., buttons, links) do not meet the recommended 44x44 px
                target size. Planned updates will improve accessibility by
                increasing target sizes.

                The website provides structured navigation, clear headings, and
                consistent layouts to assist users with cognitive disabilities.
                However, some content may exceed a lower secondary education
                reading level. Future improvements will focus on simplifying
                complex text and improving readability.
